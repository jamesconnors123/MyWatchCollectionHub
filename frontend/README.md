# Frontend Placeholder

This directory is reserved for the user interface implementation.

The high‑level design envisions a single‑page application built using a modern
JavaScript framework such as **React** or **Angular**.  The UI will allow users
to upload multiple watch images, view clustered results, search and filter
through their collection, and edit watch metadata.

At present no frontend code has been implemented.  Please see the project
README for a description of the planned features.
