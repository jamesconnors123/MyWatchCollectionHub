# MyWatchCollectionHub Online App – AI Initial Request Prompt Documentation

## Brief

I have quite a large collection of watches. Most of them are secondhand vintage watches. I have never cataloged my watches, and I would like to find a solution to do it using your AI capabilities.

I have photos of all of my watches. I was hoping that you would be able to come up with some solution where I could provide you the photos of my watches and you could Create some kind of database Or some alternative Solution to catalog each watch that you identify as being unique from the set of pictures that I give you, bearing in mind that there could be multiple pictures of the same watch From multiple angles, including from the front and the back. close up on the. Watch Face and Full photos of the watch, including the straps. This would have to harness the use of image recognition.

Then what would be good would be if you could try and identify, for each watch you catalogue, the make, model, age and approximate resale value, and possibly a paragraph of text giving information about the watch brand, and the model. Web links to any relevant web pages that have information about the watch should be stored in the database record. The database record will include all this information as well as all the images that you have. Identified for each watch.

Then ideally there should be some way to be able to have a UI or a front end to resent this information search within the watch records Etcetera.

I have written a draft High Level Design/Implementation Timeline Plan, please see section below titled “High Level Design/Implementation Timeline Plan”

Could you please review what I am describing and work out whether it is feasible and indeed whether there is better solution or changes that need to be made to what I propose to make it better?

## High Level Design/Implementation Timeline Plan

### 1. Framework Core Design

* I would like the framework to be a Java/Maven project.
* I will use IntelliJ Community Edition as the IDE on my local machine to work with the Project.

### 2. Image Recognition and Identification

* **Image Deduplication:** Use AI-based clustering (e.g., unsupervised learning) to group images of the same watch based on visual similarity.
* **Feature Extraction:** Use a pre-trained image recognition model (e.g., ResNet or YOLO) fine-tuned for watch identification to recognize makes, models, and other distinguishing features.
* **OCR for Text Recognition:** Detect and extract text (e.g., brand, model number) from the watch face or case back.

### 3. Metadata Collection

* Make, Model, and Year: Use online APIs (like Google Vision, eBay, or Watch databases) to fetch detailed information about identified watches.
* Resale Value: Scrape or query platforms like Chrono24, eBay, or WatchCharts for recent pricing information.
* Brand and Model Information: Fetch descriptions from reliable watch-related resources.

### 4. Database Design

* Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or SQLite for structured storage or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for more flexibility.
* Each record would store:
    + Unique ID
    + Clustered images
    + Identified metadata (brand, model, etc.)
    + Resale value
    + Description
    + Links to references
    + Tags for easier searching

### 5. User Interface

* Frontend: A web application built using React or Angular.
* Backend: A RESTful or GraphQL API built with Java (using Spring Boot) or Python (using Flask/Django).
* Features:
    + Search and filter by brand, model, value, year, etc.
    + Display images and metadata in a clean layout.
    + Editable records for corrections.
    + Export functionality (e.g., CSV/Excel).

### 6. Implementation Flow

1. **Image Input:** Accept multiple images and preprocess them.
2. **Clustering:** Group images to identify unique watches.
3. **AI Recognition:** Extract make, model, and text information.
4. **Data Augmentation:** Enrich metadata via external APIs.
5. **Database Population:** Save information in the database.
6. **Frontend Integration:** Present data in an interactive UI.

### 7. Feasibility Considerations

* **Scalability:** Ensure the design can handle adding more images over time.
* **Accuracy:** Fine-tune AI models for higher precision in identifying vintage watches.
* **Legal and API Limits:** Adhere to the terms of service for any data sources used (e.g., scraping watch information).
